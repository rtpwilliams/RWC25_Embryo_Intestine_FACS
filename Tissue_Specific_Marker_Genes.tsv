Expressed in only a subset of distal body wall muscles(BWM) and therefore enables the clear visualization of individual muscle arms. Expression of Mb::YFP from him-4p in first larval-stage (L1) larvae was limited to four distal BMWs posterior to the neck muscles in each quadrant. As development continued, two more distal BWMs posterior to the initial four in each quadrant also expressed Mb::YFP, albeit at lower levels.	Marker8	BWMs expressing DsRed2 driven from the muscle-specific C26G2.1 promoter showed no differences from Mb::YFP in arm morphology or the number of arms observed with the two different reporters. Therefore Mb::YFP driven from him-4p does not interfere with muscle arm number or morphology and is a useful tool to study muscle membrane extension.
